# Survival_Analysis2
In this project, using the Veteranâ€™s dataset in the survival library, I conducted Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis, a cox proportional hazard model,and a stratified cox proportion model.Throughout the project, I was checking that the assumptions of of Cox proportional hazard model and a stratified model were met in order to conduct my analysis. It should be noted that the variable descriptions are written in the R code.
