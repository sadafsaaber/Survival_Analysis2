# Survival_Analysis2
In this project, using the Veteranâ€™s dataset in the survival library, I conducted Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis, a Cox Proportional Hazard Model, and a stratified cox proportion model.Throughout the project, I was checking that the assumptions of of Cox Proportional Hazard model were met to conduct my analysis. It should be noted that the variable descriptions and other comments are in the R code.
